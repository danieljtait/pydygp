====================================
Multiplicative Latent Forces Modules
====================================

Multiplicative latent force models are a class of non-autonomous ordinary differential equations defined by evolution equations of the form

.. math::

   \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left( \mathbf{A}_0 + \sum_{r=1}^R g_r(t)\mathbf{A}_r\right)\mathbf{x}(t),

where :math:`\{ \mathbf{A}_r \}` for :math:`r=0,1,\ldots, R` are a set of constant "structure matrices" which determine the geometric structure of the space of possible solutions, and the models flexibility arises from the set of latent Gaussian processes :math:`\{ g_r(t) \}`.

We provide two methods for carrying out inference in this class of methods
