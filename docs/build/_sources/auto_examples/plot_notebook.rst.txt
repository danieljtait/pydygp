Notebook styled examples
========================

The gallery is capable of transforming Python files into reStructuredText files
with a notebook structure. For this to be used you need to respect some syntax
rules.

It makes a lot of sense to contrast this output rst file with the
:download:`original Python script <plot_notebook.py>` to get better feeling of
the necessary file structure.

Anything before the Python script docstring is ignored by sphinx-gallery and
will not appear in the rst file, nor will it be executed.
This Python docstring requires an reStructuredText title to name the file and
correctly build the reference links.

Once you close the docstring you would be writing Python code. This code gets
executed by sphinx gallery shows the plots and attaches the generating code.
Nevertheless you can break your code into blocks and give the rendered file
a notebook style. In this case you have to include a code comment breaker
a line of at least 20 hashes and then every comment start with the a new hash.

As in this example we start by first writing this module
style docstring, then for the first code block we write the example file author
and script license continued by the import modules instructions.



.. code-block:: python


    # Code source: Óscar Nájera
    # License: BSD 3 clause

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt







This code block is executed, although it produces no output. Lines starting
with a simple hash are code comment and get treated as part of the code
block. To include this new comment string we started the new block with a
long line of hashes.

The sphinx-gallery parser will assume everything after this splitter and that
continues to start with a **comment hash and space** (respecting code style)
is text that has to be rendered in
html format. Keep in mind to always keep your comments always together by
comment hashes. That means to break a paragraph you still need to commend
that line break.

In this example the next block of code produces some plotable data. Code is
executed, figure is saved and then code is presented next, followed by the
inlined figure.



.. code-block:: python


    x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 300)
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, x)
    z = np.cos(xx) + np.cos(yy)

    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(z)
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.xlabel('$x$')
    plt.ylabel('$y$')




.. image:: /auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_notebook_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Again it is possble to continue the discussion with a new Python string. This
time to introduce the next code block generates 2 separate figures.



.. code-block:: python


    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(z, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('hot'))
    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(z, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('Spectral'), interpolation='none')




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-horizontal

      .. image:: /auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_notebook_002.png
            :class: sphx-glr-multi-img

    *

      .. image:: /auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_notebook_003.png
            :class: sphx-glr-multi-img




There's some subtle differences between rendered html rendered comment
strings and code comment strings which I'll demonstrate below. (Some of this
only makes sense if you look at the
:download:`raw Python script <plot_notebook.py>`)

Comments in comment blocks remain nested in the text.



.. code-block:: python



    def dummy():
        """Dummy function to make sure docstrings don't get rendered as text"""
        pass

    # Code comments not preceded by the hash splitter are left in code blocks.

    string = """
    Triple-quoted string which tries to break parser but doesn't.
    """







Output of the script is captured:



.. code-block:: python


    print('Some output from Python')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Some output from Python


Finally, I'll call ``show`` at the end just so someone running the Python
code directly will see the plots; this is not necessary for creating the docs



.. code-block:: python


    plt.show()







You can also include :math:`math` inline, or as separate equations:

.. math::

   \exp(j\pi) = -1

You can also insert images:

   :alt: Sphinx header
